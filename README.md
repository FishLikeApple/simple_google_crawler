# simple_google_crawler
Write google searching results into a database.


# How it works
The script will save latest searching results (20 titles and urls by default) of each line (keywords) in to_search.txt into google_search_results.db (which will be created if not existing).
Note that by default the database will only save 20 latest searching results of each part of keywords.


# Environment
python3.6.5 (python3)


# How to use
You firstly write what you want to search for line by line into to_search.txt, and then run start.py.
