# simple_google_crawler
A simple google crawler

# How it works
The script will save latest searching results (20 results by default) of each line in to_search.txt into google_search_results.db (which will be created if not existing)

# How to use
You firstly write what you want to search for line by line into to_search.txt, and then run start.py.
