# simple_google_crawler
Write google searching results into a database.


# How it works
The script will save latest searching results (20 titles and urls by default) of each line in to_search.txt into google_search_results.db (which will be created if not existing).


# Environment
python3.6.5 (python3)


# How to use
You firstly write what you want to search for line by line into to_search.txt, and then run start.py.
